    <h1>Description: </h1>
    <p>You can search the web and find all sorts of burger recipes, but when it 
        comes to making a classic, no-frills, juicy hamburger, all you need is good 
        quality meat, and a good burger seasoning. There’s no need for fillers like 
        eggs or breadcrumbs. I’ll walk you through the simple steps to how to 
        prepare, season, and cook the burgers, plus make-ahead and freezing \
        instructions.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Buns with Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Good quality ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Cheese: cheddar cheese, or your favorite kind</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves.</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Onion slices</li>
        <li>pickle slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep seasoning.</strong> Combine all spices in a bowl. 
            Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Form patties.</strong> Divide ground chuck into 6 equal 
            portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider 
            than the burger buns (as they will shrink).  Use your thumb to press 
            an indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Grill.</strong> Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over 
            the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill 
            lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is 
            seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook 
            an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F. 
            If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during the last 
            minute of cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Remove patties to a plate and allow to rest 
            for a few minutes before serving in a bun, with toppings.</li>
    </ol>
